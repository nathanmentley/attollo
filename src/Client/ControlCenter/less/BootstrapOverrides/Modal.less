/*
INFO: I'm thinking we'll want to override the standard modal somehow?
        Possibly sticky to the bottom or top or something silly like that?
        We'll totally want to throw in fade affects here.
        
        Final Note: We'll want to make sure we don't design ourselves into
        a spot where we have modals in modals. So, I think modals should
        be used to fill out super basic forms, but not building complex
        objects.
        So page/email/style builder in a modal is probably a no go.
        But editing a page's title / url, or a site's name / domain, or 
        user details are probably good fits.
